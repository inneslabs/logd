# Tail & query real-time logs of many apps.
A simple program for streaming log data, built on Protobuf, SHA256, and UDP.

This program does not yet write log data to a file, although this is clearly an important feature to come.
```bash
go run .
```

# Config
The program will search up to the root for a file named `logdrc.yml`.
```yaml
# logdrc.yml
udp:
  laddr_port: ":6102"
  guard:
    history_size: 10000
    sum_ttl: 100ms
app:
  laddr_port: ":6101"
store:
  ring_sizes:
    /prod/my/app/http: 1000000
    /prod/my/app/udp: 1000000
    /debug: 10000
  fallback_size: 1000000
```
You may set your secrets in here, or as env vars.
```bash
export LOGD_READ_SECRET = "123456"
export LOGD_WRITE_SECRET = "123456"
```

# Auth
Logd authenticates clients for either reading or writing using SHA256 hash-based message authentication.

I chose to use hash-based ephemeral message authentication with a very short TTL (100ms)
because it's computationally cheap, and simple, and it's cheap to guard against replays over a short timespan.

Writing is over UDP only. This will *probably* not change for sake of simplicity, although sometimes I do wish for it.

# Logger
The simplest way to write logs is using the `logger` package.
```go
log, err := logger.NewLogger(context.TODO(), &logger.LoggerCfg{
		Host:   "some.host",
		Port:   6102,
		Secret: "your-writer-secret",
		MsgKey: "/ops/joey/my-app", // allows us to filter log data
		Stdout: true,               // also write to stdout
	})
log.Info("ðŸŒ± this is how we write logs, baby: %s", err)
```

## Custom integration
Logs are written by connecting to a UDP socket.
See the following example. Error checks skipped for brevity.
```go
// dial udp
addr, _ := conn.GetAddr("your.host")
socket, _ := conn.Dial(addr)

// serialise message using protobuf
payload, err := proto.Marshal(&cmd.Cmd{
		Name: cmd.Name_WRITE,
		Msg: &cmd.Msg{
			T:          timestamppb.Now(),
			Key:        "/your/app",
			Lvl:        cmd.Lvl_INFO,
			Txt:        "some log message",
		},
	})

// sign packet
signedMsg, _ := auth.Sign([]byte("your-secret"), payload, time.Now())

// write to socket
socket.Write(signedMsg)
```

# Protobuf
If you modify the protobuf spec in `cmd.proto`, you must re-generate the code.
```bash
# install protobuf & gen-go
brew install protobuf
brew install protoc-gen-go

# generate protobuf source files
protoc --go_out=. cmd.proto
```
